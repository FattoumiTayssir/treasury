# Created By Filter Fix - Complete

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** User `hello@gg.com` with `ownDataOnly: true` could see manual entries created by other users (System, Admin).

**Root Cause:** Backend was returning `createdBy` as **display name** instead of **user ID**.

```
Backend Response (BEFORE):
createdBy: "hello"    // Display name

Frontend Filter:
entry.createdBy === user.id  // "hello" === "4" ❌ NO MATCH
```

## 🔧 Fix Applied

Changed backend to return **user ID** in `createdBy` field.

### Files Modified:

1. **`backend/app/routers/manual_entries.py`**
   - Changed: `createdBy=movement.creator.display_name` 
   - To: `createdBy=str(movement.created_by)`
   - Applied in 4 locations (get all, get one, create, get movements)

2. **`backend/app/routers/movements.py`**
   - Changed: `createdBy=m.creator.display_name`
   - To: `createdBy=str(m.created_by)`
   - Applied in 2 locations (get all, get one)

## ✅ Verification

### API Response (AFTER FIX):

```bash
GET /manual-entries
Authorization: Bearer <hello_token>
```

**Response:**
```
Total entries: 6
- ID: 9,  createdBy: 1, Ref: TEST-REF-1        (System)
- ID: 16, createdBy: 1, Ref: EM-16-1           (System)
- ID: 17, createdBy: 1, Ref: dghdfqsh-1-1      (System)
- ID: 19, createdBy: 4, Ref: TEST-HELLO-1      (hello) ✅
- ID: 20, createdBy: 4, Ref: EM-20-1           (hello) ✅
- ID: 21, createdBy: 4, Ref: EM-21-1           (hello) ✅
```

### Frontend Filter Logic:

```typescript
// pages/ManualEntries.tsx
const entryPerm = user?.permissions.find(p => p.tabName === 'manual-entries')
if (entryPerm?.ownDataOnly && user) {
  filteredManualEntries = filteredManualEntries.filter(entry => 
    entry.createdBy === user.id  // "4" === "4" ✅ MATCHES
  )
}
```

### Expected Results:

**User:** `hello@gg.com` (ID: 4)  
**Permission:** `manual-entries: ownDataOnly=true`

**Before Fix:**
```
Frontend shows ALL 6 entries ❌
```

**After Fix:**
```
Frontend shows ONLY 3 entries ✅
- ID: 19 (created by user 4)
- ID: 20 (created by user 4)  
- ID: 21 (created by user 4)
```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Filter Chain:

1. **Backend returns all entries** from user's companies
   ```json
   [
     {"id": "9", "createdBy": "1"},   // System
     {"id": "19", "createdBy": "4"},  // hello
     {"id": "20", "createdBy": "4"}   // hello
   ]
   ```

2. **Frontend applies company filter**
   ```typescript
   entries.filter(e => selectedCompanies.includes(e.companyId))
   ```

3. **Frontend applies ownDataOnly filter**
   ```typescript
   if (ownDataOnly) {
     entries.filter(e => e.createdBy === user.id)
     // Keeps: "4" === "4" ✅
     // Removes: "1" === "4" ❌
   }
   ```

4. **Result: User sees only their own entries** ✅

## 🧪 Test Verification

### User Login:
```
User ID: 4
Permissions: ownDataOnly: true (for manual-entries)
```

### Comparison:
```
entry.createdBy = "4" (user ID)
user.id = "4"
Match: "4" === "4" ✅ PASS
```
