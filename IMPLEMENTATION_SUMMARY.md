# User Management System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

A complete user management system with JWT authentication and granular permissions has been successfully implemented.

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. **Database Layer**
- ✅ Added `password_hash` column to User table
- ✅ Created `tab_permissions` table for available tabs
- ✅ Created `user_tab_permissions` table for user-specific permissions
- ✅ Created migration scripts that run automatically on DB init
- ✅ Seeded default admin user with bcrypt-hashed password

### 2. **Backend API (FastAPI)**
- ✅ JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ Auth middleware for route protection
- ✅ Permission checking utilities
- ✅ Complete auth router with login/logout/me endpoints
- ✅ Complete user management router (Admin-only CRUD)
- ✅ User permission management API
- ✅ Company assignment per user
- ✅ Updated all schemas and models

### 3. **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**
- ✅ User Management page with full CRUD interface
- ✅ UserDialog component for creating/editing users
- ✅ Real JWT authentication (replaced mock auth)
- ✅ Permission-based navigation filtering
- ✅ Route protection with PermissionRoute component
- ✅ Updated auth store with permission checks
- ✅ Removed Dashboard (as requested)
- ✅ Analytics is now the landing page

## 🔑 Key Features

### Authentication
- **JWT tokens** with 24-hour expiration
- **Bcrypt password hashing** (industry standard)
- **Secure token storage** in localStorage
- **Automatic token injection** in API requests

### Authorization
- **Two roles**: Admin (full access) and Manager (limited by permissions)
- **Tab-level permissions**: Each tab can have view/modify rights
- **Company-level access**: Users can be restricted to specific companies
- **Route protection**: Both frontend and backend enforce permissions

### User Management (Admin Only)
- **Create users** with password, role, companies, and permissions
- **Edit users** including password reset capability
- **Delete users** with safety check (can't delete self)
- **View all users** with their roles, companies, and permission counts
- **Visual permission management** with checkboxes for each tab

### Permission System
- **5 Available Tabs**:
  - Analytics (Analyse)
  - Movements (Mouvements)
  - Manual Entries (Entrées manuelles)
  - Exceptions
  - Settings (Paramètres)

- **2 Permission Levels per Tab**:
  - **View**: Can see the tab and read data
  - **Modify**: Can view AND edit/create/delete data

- **Smart Permission Logic**:
  - Setting modify=true automatically sets view=true
  - Setting view=false automatically sets modify=false
  - Admins bypass all checks

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Password never stored in plain text** - Only bcrypt hashes
2. **JWT tokens** signed and verified
3. **Admin-only endpoints** protected with dependencies
4. **Permission checks** on both frontend and backend
5. **Company isolation** for data access
6. **Cannot delete own admin account**
7. **Password optional on user update** (only changes if provided)

## 📊 Default Configuration

### Admin User
```
Email: admin@treasury.local
Password: admin123
Role: Admin
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Change this password immediately after deployment!

### Available Tabs (for permission assignment)
1. analytics - View and analyze financial data
2. movements - Manage financial movements
3. manual-entries - Manage manual entries
4. exceptions - Handle exceptions
5. settings - Treasury settings and configuration

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

```bash
# Stop current services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and restart (applies migrations automatically)
docker-compose up -d --build

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Verify database
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d appdb -c "\dt"
```

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Basic Authentication
- [ ] Can access http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Login page appears
- [ ] Can login as admin@treasury.local / admin123
- [ ] JWT token stored in localStorage
- [ ] User info displayed correctly

### Admin Functions
- [ ] "Gestion des utilisateurs" visible in sidebar (admin only)
- [ ] Can access /users page
- [ ] Can see list of all users
- [ ] Can create new user
- [ ] Can set user password
- [ ] Can assign companies to user
- [ ] Can set tab permissions (view/modify)
- [ ] Can edit existing user
- [ ] Can change user password
- [ ] Can delete user (except self)

### Manager User Testing
- [ ] Create a test manager user
- [ ] Assign limited permissions
- [ ] Logout admin
- [ ] Login as manager
- [ ] Only see permitted tabs in sidebar
- [ ] Cannot access restricted tabs
- [ ] Cannot access /users page
- [ ] View-only tabs don't show edit buttons

### Permission Testing
- [ ] Manager with view-only sees read-only data
- [ ] Manager with modify can create/edit/delete
- [ ] Admin sees all tabs including user management
- [ ] Unauthorized route access redirects to /analytics

### Navigation
- [ ] Dashboard removed from sidebar
- [ ] "/" redirects to "/analytics"
- [ ] Only tabs with permissions shown
- [ ] Admin sees separator + User Management

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### User Management Page
- Clean table layout with user information
- Role badges (purple for Admin, blue for Manager)
- Company chips showing assignments
- Permission count display
- Edit/Delete action buttons
- Responsive design

### User Dialog
- Tabbed sections for organization
- Name, email, password, role fields
- Company selection with checkboxes
- Permission matrix with view/modify toggles
- Smart permission dependencies
- Password optional on edit
- Admin users show "All permissions" note

### Sidebar
- Permission-filtered navigation
- Admin-only section with separator
- Active state highlighting
- Icons for each tab

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

1. **TypeScript Warning**: The `import.meta.env` warning has been resolved with vite-env.d.ts
2. **Default Password**: Must be changed in production
3. **JWT Secret**: Hardcoded for development, should use env var in production

## 🎓 User Roles Explained

### Admin
- **Access**: Everything
- **Can See**: All tabs + User Management
- **Can Do**: Full CRUD on all data + manage users
- **Companies**: All (or assigned specific ones)
- **Permissions**: Bypass all checks

### Manager
- **Access**: Based on assigned permissions
- **Can See**: Only tabs with view permission
- **Can Do**: Create/edit/delete only in tabs with modify permission
- **Companies**: Only assigned companies
- **Permissions**: Explicitly set per tab

## 🔄 Permission Flow

```
User Login
    ↓
Backend validates credentials
    ↓
Generate JWT with user_id
    ↓
Return user object with permissions array
    ↓
Frontend stores token + user
    ↓
On route navigation:
    - Check user.role === 'Admin' → Allow all
    - Check user.permissions for tab
    - Allow if can_view (read) or can_modify (write)
    ↓
API calls include JWT in Authorization header
    ↓
Backend validates token
    ↓
Backend checks permissions via auth_utils
    ↓
Return data or 403 Forbidden
```
