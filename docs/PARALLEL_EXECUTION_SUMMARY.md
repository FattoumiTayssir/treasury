# Parallel ETL Execution Implementation

## Date: 2025-10-12 17:06

## User Request
> "now i want to run all three in async"

## Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

All three ETL scripts now execute **in parallel** using Python's `asyncio` module.

---

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
run_all_etls.py (main process)
    ‚îú‚îÄ> asyncio.gather()
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ> ETL 1: achat_importation_upsert.py (subprocess)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ> ETL 2: ventes_locales_upsert.py (subprocess)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ> ETL 3: achats_locaux_echeance_upsert.py (subprocess)
    ‚îî‚îÄ> Wait for all to complete
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Async Subprocess Execution
```python
async def run_etl_script_async(etl_config: Dict) -> Dict:
    process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
        sys.executable, script_path,
        stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE
    )
    stdout, stderr = await asyncio.wait_for(
        process.communicate(),
        timeout=600  # 10 minute timeout per ETL
    )
```

#### 2. Parallel Execution
```python
async def run_all_etls_async():
    # Create tasks for all ETLs
    tasks = [run_etl_script_async(etl_config) for etl_config in ETL_SCRIPTS]
    
    # Run all in parallel
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

#### 3. Main Entry Point
```python
def main():
    exit_code = asyncio.run(run_all_etls_async())
    sys.exit(exit_code)
```

## Performance Results

### Before: Sequential Execution
```
Achat Importation:     5.17s  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
Ventes Locales:        9.41s  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ> Total: 15.32s
Achats Locaux:         0.74s  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### After: Parallel Execution
```
                    ‚îå‚îÄ> Achat Importation:  5.07s
Start ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ> Ventes Locales:     8.67s ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Total: 8.67s
                    ‚îî‚îÄ> Achats Locaux:      1.36s
```

### Performance Gain
- **Sequential:** 15.32 seconds
- **Parallel:** 8.67 seconds
- **Improvement:** 43% faster (6.65 seconds saved)

**Total execution time is now limited by the slowest ETL (Ventes Locales).**

## Test Results

### Execution Log
```
================================================================================
Starting ETL Pipeline Execution (Parallel Mode)
Execution Time: 2025-10-12 17:06:05
Running 3 ETLs in parallel...
================================================================================

All 3 ETLs started simultaneously at 17:06:05

‚úì Achats Locaux avec √âch√©ance completed in 1.36s (finished first)
‚úì Achat Importation completed in 5.07s
‚úì Ventes Locales completed in 8.67s (finished last)

Total Execution Time: 8.67 seconds (0.14 minutes)
Exit Code: 0 (Success)
```

### Order of Completion
1. **Achats Locaux avec √âch√©ance** - 1.36s (fastest)
2. **Achat Importation** - 5.07s (medium)
3. **Ventes Locales** - 8.67s (slowest, determines total time)

## Technical Details

### Async Implementation

#### Module: `asyncio`
- **Standard library:** No additional dependencies required
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Linux, Windows, macOS
- **Event loop:** Single-threaded async/await pattern

#### Subprocess Management
- Each ETL runs as a separate Python subprocess
- Stdout/stderr captured asynchronously
- Timeout handling per ETL (10 minutes each)
- Process cleanup on timeout or error

### Error Handling

#### Individual ETL Failures
- If one ETL fails, others continue running
- Failed ETL logs error and returns failure status
- Final summary shows which ETLs succeeded/failed

#### Timeout Handling
```python
try:
    stdout, stderr = await asyncio.wait_for(
        process.communicate(),
        timeout=600
    )
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    process.kill()
    await process.wait()
    # Log timeout and continue
```

#### Global Exceptions
- KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) exits gracefully
- Unhandled exceptions logged with traceback
- Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (failure), 130 (interrupted)

---

## Benefits

### 1. Performance
- **43% faster** execution time
- Scales with number of ETLs (more ETLs = more benefit)
- I/O bound operations benefit most from parallelism

### 2. Efficiency
- Better resource utilization
- ETLs don't wait for each other
- SQL Server and Odoo handle concurrent connections

### 3. Reliability
- Independent execution (one failure doesn't block others)
- Per-ETL timeout handling
- Comprehensive error reporting

### 4. Observability
- Real-time progress for all ETLs
- Clear start/completion logging
- Individual duration tracking

---

## Considerations

### Database Connections
- Each ETL creates its own PostgreSQL connection
- Connections are independent and don't interfere
- PostgreSQL handles concurrent writes gracefully

### Odoo API
- Each ETL makes its own Odoo API calls
- Parallel requests to Odoo API
- No rate limiting issues observed (3 concurrent connections)

### Delete-Then-Insert Strategy
- Each ETL deletes only its own references
- No conflicts between parallel ETLs
- Exception deletes are scoped by ETL type

### Resource Usage
- CPU: Minimal (mostly I/O bound)
- Memory: 3x process memory (one per ETL)
- Network: 3x connections (Odoo + PostgreSQL)

---

## Comparison to Alternatives

### Why asyncio instead of threading?
- ‚úÖ Simpler error handling
- ‚úÖ Better for I/O-bound tasks (Odoo API, PostgreSQL)
- ‚úÖ No GIL contention issues
- ‚úÖ Standard library, no dependencies

### Why asyncio instead of multiprocessing?
- ‚úÖ Lower overhead (no process forking)
- ‚úÖ Easier communication between tasks
- ‚úÖ Better for I/O-bound workloads
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiprocessing would be better for CPU-bound tasks (not our case)

### Why subprocess instead of direct imports?
- ‚úÖ Process isolation (one crash doesn't affect others)
- ‚úÖ Easier timeout handling
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Existing ETL scripts unchanged

---

## Code Changes

### Modified Files
- **`run_all_etls.py`** - Converted to async/await pattern

### Changes Summary
1. Added `import asyncio`
2. Created `async def run_etl_script_async()`
3. Created `async def run_all_etls_async()`
4. Modified `main()` to use `asyncio.run()`
5. Updated logging messages to "Parallel Mode"

### Lines Changed
- ~70 lines modified
- No changes to individual ETL scripts
- Backward compatible (can still run ETLs individually)

---

## Usage

### Run Parallel Pipeline
```bash
poetry run python run_all_etls.py
```

All three ETLs run concurrently.

### Run Individual ETL (Sequential)
```bash
poetry run python etl_jobs/achat_importation_upsert.py
poetry run python etl_jobs/ventes_locales_upsert.py
poetry run python etl_jobs/achats_locaux_echeance_upsert.py
```

Still works as before for testing individual ETLs.

## Performance Evolution Timeline

| Date | Change | Time | Improvement |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| Initial | MERGE upsert (sequential) | 225s | Baseline |
| Oct 12 AM | Delete-then-insert | 60s | 73% faster |
| Oct 12 PM | Unpaid filter only | 15.32s | 93% faster |
| Oct 12 PM | **Parallel execution** | **8.67s** | **96% faster** |

**Total improvement: 225s ‚Üí 8.67s = 96% reduction in execution time! üöÄ**

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Optimizations
1. **Connection pooling** - Reuse PostgreSQL connections
2. **Batch processing** - Insert multiple records at once
3. **Caching** - Cache Odoo user/company lookups
4. **Incremental loads** - Only process changed records

### Monitoring
- Add execution time metrics to database
- Track ETL completion rates
- Alert on timeouts or failures

### Scalability
- Current: 3 ETLs in parallel
- Future: Add more ETL types without changing architecture
- Parallel execution automatically scales with number of ETLs

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: ETLs compete for database locks
**Solution:** Each ETL deletes different references, no conflicts

### Issue: Odoo API rate limiting
**Solution:** Not observed with 3 concurrent connections. Monitor if adding more ETLs.

### Issue: Timeout on slow networks
**Solution:** Increase timeout in `run_etl_script_async()` (currently 600s)

### Issue: One ETL hangs
**Solution:** Individual timeout handling prevents blocking others
