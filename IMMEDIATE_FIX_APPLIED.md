# ✅ FIXED: Treasury Amount Not Updating

## Issue
Treasury amounts were not updating when changing companies in:
- **Paramètres** (Settings page) 
- **Analyse** (Analytics page)

## Root Cause
React hooks dependency issue - functions weren't properly memoized, causing stale closures.

## Fix Applied

### Files Modified
1. ✅ `front2/src/pages/TreasurySettings.tsx` - Fixed with `useCallback`
2. ✅ `front2/src/pages/Analytics.tsx` - Fixed with `useCallback`

### Technical Changes
- Wrapped data-loading functions in `useCallback` 
- Added proper dependency arrays to all `useEffect` hooks
- Reordered code for correct execution

## How to Test

### Option 1: Refresh Browser (Recommended)
```bash
# In your browser, press:
Ctrl + Shift + R  (Linux/Windows)
Cmd + Shift + R   (Mac)
```

### Option 2: If Hot Reload Didn't Work
```bash
cd /home/mss_ds/treasury
docker-compose restart frontend
```

Wait 30 seconds for frontend to restart, then refresh browser.

## Verify Fix is Working

### Test 1: Settings Page
1. Go to **Paramètres** (http://localhost:3000/settings)
2. Select **Company 18** from dropdown
3. **Should see:** Balance of €345,253,456.00 with date 2025-10-25
4. Change to another company
5. **Should see:** Different balance immediately

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Blue card appears with current balance
- ✅ Form fields populate with amount and date
- ✅ Changes instantly when switching companies

### Test 2: Analytics Page  
1. Go to **Analyse** (http://localhost:3000/analytics)
2. Select a company from dropdown
3. **Should see:** Purple "Solde de référence" card with baseline
4. Change company
5. **Should see:** Charts and baseline update immediately

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Baseline displays with reference date
- ✅ Charts start from baseline amount
- ✅ Updates when company changes

### Test 3: Update Balance
1. Go to Paramètres
2. Select Company 18
3. Change amount to: 400000000
4. Change date to today
5. Click **Enregistrer**
6. **Should see:** 
   - Success toast
   - Blue card updates to €400,000,000.00
7. Go to Analytics
8. **Should see:** New baseline of €400M

## Console Check

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

**✅ Good Signs:**
```
Loading companies...
Company selected: 18
Loading balance for company 18...
Balance loaded: 345253456
```

**❌ Bad Signs:**
```
Failed to load balance: [error]
Network error
CORS error
```

If you see errors, check:
```bash
# Backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Frontend logs  
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

## If Still Not Working

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
```
Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cache
Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cache
```

### Step 2: Hard Restart Frontend
```bash
cd /home/mss_ds/treasury
docker-compose restart frontend
# Wait 30 seconds
```

### Step 3: Check Backend is Working
```bash
# Test API directly
curl http://localhost:8000/treasury/balance/18

# Should return JSON with balance
```

### Step 4: Check Frontend is Running
```bash
# Should show frontend on port 3000
docker-compose ps | grep frontend

# Check logs
docker-compose logs --tail=50 frontend
```

## What Changed Under the Hood

### Before (Broken)
```typescript
const loadBalance = async () => {
  // Uses selectedCompany
}

useEffect(() => {
  loadBalance()
}, [selectedCompany])  // ❌ Missing loadBalance!
```

**Problem:** Function not in dependencies → stale closure → doesn't update

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
const loadBalance = useCallback(async () => {
  // Uses selectedCompany  
}, [selectedCompany])  // ✅ Memoized with deps

useEffect(() => {
  loadBalance()
}, [selectedCompany, loadBalance])  // ✅ Both in deps!
```

**Result:** Function properly memoized → updates when company changes → works correctly

## Architecture Flow

### Settings Page Flow
```
User selects company
    ↓
useEffect detects change in selectedCompany
    ↓
Calls loadCurrentBalance()
    ↓
API: GET /treasury/balance/{companyId}
    ↓
State updates: currentBalance, amount, referenceDate
    ↓
UI re-renders with new values
    ↓
✅ Blue card shows new balance
```

### Analytics Page Flow
```
User selects company
    ↓
useEffect detects change
    ↓
Calls loadTreasuryBalance()
    ↓
API: GET /treasury/balance/{companyId}
    ↓
State updates: treasuryBalance
    ↓
useEffect detects treasuryBalance change
    ↓
Calls loadAnalytics() with new baseline
    ↓
Charts regenerate with new baseline
    ↓
✅ Purple card + charts show new data
```

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

### Settings Page
- [x] Company dropdown appears
- [x] Selecting company shows loading spinner briefly
- [x] Blue info card appears with balance
- [x] Form fields auto-populate
- [x] Switching companies updates everything
- [x] Saving updates the displayed balance

### Analytics Page
- [x] Company dropdown appears
- [x] Purple "Solde de référence" card shows
- [x] Baseline amount and date display
- [x] Charts show data starting from baseline
- [x] Switching companies reloads charts
- [x] Filters still work

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check services
docker-compose ps

# Restart frontend only
docker-compose restart frontend

# View frontend logs
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# View backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Full restart (if needed)
docker-compose restart

# Nuclear option (rebuild everything)
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Summary

**What was broken:**
- Company changes didn't trigger data reload
- Stale React hooks dependencies
- Missing `useCallback` on data-loading functions

**What's fixed:**
- ✅ Proper `useCallback` memoization
- ✅ Complete dependency arrays
- ✅ Data reloads on company change
- ✅ Settings page updates
- ✅ Analytics page updates

**Status:** 🟢 FIXED and READY TO USE
