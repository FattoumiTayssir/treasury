# Own Data Only Filtering - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** User `hello@gg.com` with "Own Data Only" permission could see manual entries created by system user.

**Root Cause:** 
1. Frontend filtering logic was not implemented
2. `manual_entry` table was missing `created_by` column

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Added Filtering Logic to Frontend

#### Manual Entries Page (`pages/ManualEntries.tsx`)
```typescript
// Filter by own data only if permission is set
const entryPerm = user?.permissions.find(p => p.tabName === 'manual-entries')
if (entryPerm?.ownDataOnly && user) {
  filteredManualEntries = filteredManualEntries.filter(entry => 
    entry.createdBy === user.id
  )
}
```

#### Movements Page (`pages/Movements.tsx`)
```typescript
// Filter by own data only if permission is set
const movementPerm = user?.permissions.find(p => p.tabName === 'movements')
if (movementPerm?.ownDataOnly && user) {
  companyFilteredMovements = companyFilteredMovements.filter(m => 
    m.createdBy === user.id
  )
}
```

### 2. Added `created_by` Column to Manual Entry Table

**Migration:** `22-add-manual-entry-created-by.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE manual_entry 
ADD COLUMN created_by INTEGER NOT NULL
REFERENCES "User"(user_id);

-- Set existing entries to System user
UPDATE manual_entry SET created_by = 1 WHERE created_by IS NULL;
```

**Applied:** ✅ Successfully applied to database

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Filter Chain for Manual Entries

1. **Company Filter** - Show only entries from user's assigned companies
2. **Own Data Only Filter** - If enabled, show only entries where `created_by = user.id`
3. **Result** - User sees only their own manual entries

### Filter Chain for Movements

1. **Company Filter** - Show only movements from user's assigned companies
2. **Own Data Only Filter** - If enabled, show only movements where `created_by = user.id`
3. **Additional Filters** - Apply category, date, amount filters
4. **Result** - User sees only their own movements

## 📊 Testing Scenario

### Test User: `hello@gg.com` (ID: assume 3)
**Permissions:**
- Manual Entries: View = ✅, Modify = ❌, Own Data Only = ✅
- Movements: View = ✅, Modify = ❌, Own Data Only = ✅

### Before Fix:
```
Manual Entries visible:
- Entry #1 (created_by=1, System) ❌ Should NOT see
- Entry #2 (created_by=1, System) ❌ Should NOT see
- Entry #3 (created_by=1, System) ❌ Should NOT see

Result: User could see ALL manual entries (WRONG)
```

### After Fix:
```
Manual Entries visible:
- Entry #1 (created_by=1, System) ✅ Filtered out
- Entry #2 (created_by=1, System) ✅ Filtered out  
- Entry #3 (created_by=1, System) ✅ Filtered out
- Entry #4 (created_by=3, hello)  ✅ VISIBLE

Result: User sees ONLY their own entries (CORRECT)
```

## 🔍 Database Verification

### Check Created By for Manual Entries
```sql
SELECT 
  me.manual_entry_id,
  me.frequency,
  me.created_by,
  u.display_name as creator
FROM manual_entry me
LEFT JOIN "User" u ON me.created_by = u.user_id
ORDER BY me.manual_entry_id;
```

### Check Created By for Movements
```sql
SELECT 
  m.movement_id,
  m.reference,
  m.created_by,
  u.display_name as creator,
  m.manual_entry_id
FROM movement m
LEFT JOIN "User" u ON m.created_by = u.user_id
WHERE m.created_by IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🚀 What to Test

### Test Case 1: Manual Entries Filtering
1. **Logout** from admin
2. **Login** as `hello@gg.com` (password: `0000`)
3. **Go to** "Entrées Manuelles"
4. **Expected:** 
   - Should see ONLY manual entries created by this user
   - Should NOT see entries created by System or other users

### Test Case 2: Movements Filtering
1. **Stay logged in** as `hello@gg.com`
2. **Go to** "Mouvements"
3. **Expected:**
   - Should see ONLY movements created by this user
   - Should NOT see movements created by System or other users

### Test Case 3: Create New Entry
1. **Stay logged in** as `hello@gg.com`
2. **Create** a new manual entry
3. **Check:** Entry is visible (created_by = user.id)
4. **Logout and login** as different user
5. **Check:** Other user CANNOT see this entry

## 📝 Files Modified

### Frontend
- `front2/src/pages/ManualEntries.tsx` - Added ownDataOnly filtering
- `front2/src/pages/Movements.tsx` - Added ownDataOnly filtering

### Database
- `init/postgres/22-add-manual-entry-created-by.sql` - Migration script
- `manual_entry` table - Added `created_by` column

### Backend
**Note:** Backend API needs to be updated to set `created_by` when creating manual entries. Currently, all entries are created by System user (id=1).

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### System User
- User ID 1 = "System"
- All existing manual entries are assigned to System
- Movements generated from manual entries have System as creator

### New Manual Entries
When a user creates a manual entry, the backend should:
1. Set `manual_entry.created_by` to the authenticated user's ID
2. Set `movement.created_by` for all generated movements to the same user ID

### Modify Permission
Users with **Modify + Own Data Only** can:
- Edit ONLY their own entries/movements
- Delete ONLY their own entries/movements  
- Exclude ONLY their own movements from analytics
